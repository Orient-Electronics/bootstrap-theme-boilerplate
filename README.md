## About Bootstrap

## Quick start
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.3`

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/docs/getting-started/build-tools.md#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `grunt` (or a specific set of Grunt tasks) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.
